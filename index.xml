      <description>Call of Duty&amp;rsquo;s Zombie Mod stands as an adrenaline-packed action and daunting challenge. This game mode puts players through a test of endurance. However, sometimes, the thrill of the game can morph into frustration as the difficulty spikes. It&amp;rsquo;s at times like these that a touch of ingenuity can alter the table&amp;rsquo;s turn. As a seasoned player and a passionate hacker, I believe in tilting the scales a bit towards our favor every once in a while.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever found yourself intrigued by the complex science behind how exactly your written code transforms into an understandable stream of zeroes and ones, then you&amp;rsquo;re in exactly the right place. The realm of computer science goes far beyond just writing lines of code â€” at its core, it is about facilitating communication between humans and machines. This blog post pulls back the curtain on one such essential tool that makes this interaction possible: compilers.</description>

      <description>In my quest to better comprehend the fascinating intricacies of compilation process, compiler, and interpreter knowledge, I embarked on a journey of creating my own programming language - KarolaScript.
KarolaScript is a decidely bare-bones, yet enlightening endeavor, which brings the underpinnings of a language interpreter to the foreground. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t boast rich features like an interactive debugger or a sophisticated static analyzer, as its primary purpose is to serve as a learning playground.</description>

      <description>This game is small enough not to be overwhelming, yet complex enough to make it a fun challenge. While there are definitely easier ways to crack this code, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen a learn-as-I-go approach which might not be the quickest, but undoubtedly helps me delve deeper into the essence of reverse engineering.
 Imported Libraries Since minesweeper is a GUI application, it uses graphics function which prints those graphics to the screen.</description>
