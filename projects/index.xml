      <description>About project DirDigger is an efficient directory digging and busting tool that offers a range of features surpassing those of its alternatives. It serves a dual purpose, being an invaluable asset for both CTF enthusiasts and individuals engaged in the scanning of web app directories and API URLs encompassing bug bounty programs.
Originally conceived as a portfolio project to create a Burp extension similar to gobuster/dirbuster, DirDigger experienced the creation and implementation of novel ideas and features, transforming it into a fully comprehensive directory digging tool.</description>
